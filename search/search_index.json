Login credentials are: Username: admin Password: admin","title":"Demo"},{"location":"api/","text":"API Baby Buddy uses the Django REST Framework (DRF) to provide a REST API. The only requirement for (most) requests is to set the Authorization header as described in the Authentication section. The one exception is the /api endpoint, which lists all available endpoints and does not require authorization. Currently, the following endpoints are available for GET , OPTIONS , and POST requests: /api/bmi/ (Body Mass Index) /api/children/ /api/changes/ (Diaper Changes) /api/feedings/ /api/head-circumference/ /api/height/ /api/notes/ /api/pumping/ /api/sleep/ /api/tags/ /api/temperature/ /api/timers/ /api/tummy-times/ /api/weight/ Authentication The TokenAuthentication and SessionAuthentication are enabled by default. Session authentication covers local API requests made by the application itself. Token authentication allows external requests to be made. :exclamation: In a production environment, token authentication should only be used for API calls to an https endpoint. :exclamation: Each user has an API key that can be used for token authentication. This key can be found on the User Settings page for the logged in the user. To use a key for an API request, set the request Authorization header to Token <user-key> . E.g. Authorization: Token 2h23807gd72h7hop382p98hd823dw3g665g56 If no Authorization header set, or the key is not valid the API will return 403 Forbidden with additional details in the response body. Schema The API schema in OpenAPI format can be found in the openapi-schema.yml file in the project root. A live version is also available at the /api/schema path of a running instance. GET Method Request The limit and offset request parameters can be used to limit and offset the results set respectively. For example, the following request will return five diaper changes starting from the 10th diaper change entry: curl -X GET 'https://[...]/api/changes/?limit=5&offset=10' -H 'Authorization: Token [...]' { \"count\" : 20 , \"next\" : \"https://[...]/api/changes/?limit=5&offset=15\" , \"previous\" : \"https://[...]/api/changes/?limit=5&offset=5\" , \"results\" : [] } Field-based filters for specific endpoints can be found the in the filters field of the OPTIONS response for specific endpoints. Single entries can also be retrieved by adding the ID (or in the case of a Child entry, the slug) of a particular entry: curl -X GET https:// [ ... ] /api/children/gregory-hill/ -H 'Authorization: Token [...]' { \"id\" : 3 , \"first_name\" : \"Gregory\" , \"last_name\" : \"Hill\" , \"birth_date\" : \"2020-02-11\" , \"slug\" : \"gregory-hill\" , \"picture\" : null } curl -X GET https:// [ ... ] /api/sleep/1/ -H 'Authorization: Token [...]' { \"id\" : 480 , \"child\" : 3 , \"start\" : \"2020-03-12T21:25:28.916016-07:00\" , \"end\" : \"2020-03-13T01:34:28.916016-07:00\" , \"duration\" : \"04:09:00\" , \"nap\" : false } Response Returns JSON data in the response body in the following format: { \"count\" : <i nt > , \"next\" : <url> , \"previous\" : <url> , \"results\" :[{ ... }] } count : Total number of records ( in the database , not just the response). next : URL for the next set of results. previous : URL for the previous set of results. results : An array of the results of the request. For single entries, returns JSON data in the response body keyed by model field names. This will vary between models. OPTIONS Method Request All endpoints will respond to an OPTIONS request with detailed information about the endpoint's purpose, parameters, filters, etc. Response Returns JSON data in the response body describing the endpoint, available options for POST requests, and available filters for GET requests. The following example describes the /api/children endpoint: { \"name\" : \"Child List\" , \"renders\" : [ \"application/json\" , \"text/html\" ], \"parses\" : [ \"application/json\" , \"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\" , \"multipart/form-data\" ], \"actions\" : { \"POST\" : { \"id\" : { \"type\" : \"integer\" , \"required\" : false , \"read_only\" : true , \"label\" : \"ID\" }, [ ... ] } }, \"filters\" : [ \"first_name\" , \"last_name\" , \"slug\" ] } POST Method Request To add new entries for a particular endpoint, send a POST request with the entry data in JSON format in the request body. The Content-Type header for POST request must be set to application/json . Regular sanity checks will be performed on relevant data. See the OPTIONS response for a particular endpoint for details on required fields and data formats. Timer Field POST requests also accept a timer field to model endpoints supporting duration (Feeding, Sleep, Tummy Time). Set timer to a valid timer ID in a request instead of the start and end fields. The new entry will use the start and end values from the Timer and if the timer is running it will be stopped by this operation. Additionally, if the Timer has a child relationship, the child field will be filled in automatically with the child value from the Timer. The timer field will always override the relevant fields ( child , start , and end ) on the request. E.g., a POST request with both the timer and end fields will ignore the end field value and replace it with the Timer's end value. The same applies for start and child . These fields are all required if the timer field is not set. Example timer field usage Create a new timer associated with a child : curl --location --request POST '[...]/api/timers/' \\ --header 'Authorization: Token [...]' \\ --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ --data-raw '{\"child\": 1}' Note the timer id in the response: { \"id\" : 5 , \"child\" : 1 , \"name\" : null , \"start\" : \"2022-05-28T19:59:40.013914Z\" , \"duration\" : null , \"user\" : 1 } Create a new tummy time entry supplying only the timer id : curl --location --request POST '[...]/api/tummy-times/' \\ --header 'Authorization: Token [...]' \\ --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ --data-raw '{\"timer\": 5}' Note that child and start match the timer values (and end is auto-populated): { \"id\" : 162 , \"child\" : 1 , \"start\" : \"2022-05-28T19:59:40.013914Z\" , \"end\" : \"2022-05-28T20:01:13.549099Z\" , \"duration\" : \"00:01:33.535185\" , \"milestone\" : \"\" , \"tags\" : [] } Also note that the timer has been deleted. Response Returns JSON data in the response body describing the added/updated instance or error details keyed by either the field in error or the general string non_field_errors (e.g., when validation involves multiple fields). PATCH Method Request To update existing entries, send a PATCH request to the single entry endpoint for the entry to be updated. The Content-Type header for PATCH request must be set to application/json . For example, to update a Diaper Change entry with ID 947 to indicate a \"wet\" diaper only: curl -X PATCH \\ -H 'Authorization: Token [...]' \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -d '{\"wet\":1, \"solid\":0}' \\ https:// [ ... ] /api/changes/947/ Regular sanity checks will be performed on relevant data. See the OPTIONS response for a particular endpoint for details on required fields and data formats. Response Returns JSON data in the response body describing the added/updated instance or error details keyed by either the field in error or the general string non_field_errors (e.g., when validation involves multiple fields). DELETE Method Request To delete an existing entry, send a DELETE request to the single entry endpoint to be deleted. For example, to delete a Diaper Change entry with ID 947: curl -X DELETE https:// [ ... ] /api/changes/947/ -H 'Authorization: Token [...]' Response Returns an empty response with HTTP status code 204 on success, or a JSON encoded error detail if an error occurred (e.g. {\"detail\":\"Not found.\"} if the requested ID does not exist).","title":"API"},{"location":"api/#api","text":"Baby Buddy uses the Django REST Framework (DRF) to provide a REST API.

Baby Buddy's management commands are defined in babybuddy/management/commands . Commands gulp Executes the build and watch commands and runs Django's development server. This command also accepts the special parameter --ip for setting the server IP address. See gulp runserver for details. build Creates all script, style and \"extra\" assets and places them in the babybuddy/static folder. docs:build Builds the documentation site in a local directory ( site by default). docs:deploy Deploys the documentation site to GitHub Pages. docs:watch Runs a local server for the documentation site reloading whenever documentation sites files (in the docs directory) as modified. clean Deletes all build folders and the root static folder. Generally this should be run before a gulp build to remove previous build files and the generated static assets. collectstatic Executes Django's collectstatic management task. This task relies on files in the babybuddy/static folder, so generally gulp build should be run before this command for production deployments. Gulp also passes along non-overlapping arguments for this command, e.g. --no-input . Note: a SECRET_KEY value must be set for this command to work. compilemessages Executes Django's compilemessages management task. See django-admin compilemessages for more details about other options and functionality of this command. coverage Create a test coverage report. See .coveragerc for default settings information. extras Copies \"extra\" files (fonts, images and server root contents) to the build folder. fake Adds some fake data to the database. By default, fake creates one child and 31 days of random data. Use the --children and --days flags to change the default values, e.g. gulp fake --children 5 --days 7 to generate five fake children and seven days of data for each. format Formats Baby Buddy's code base using black . Run this before commits to ensure linting will pass! generateschema Updates the openapi-schema.yml file in the project root based on current API functionality. lint Executes Python and SASS linting for all relevant source files. makemessages Executes Django's makemessages management task. See django-admin makemessages for more details about other options and functionality of this command. When working on a single translation, the -l flag is useful to make message for only that language, e.g. gulp makemessages -l fr to make only a French language translation file. makemigrations Executes Django's makemigrations management task. Gulp also passes along non-overlapping arguments for this command. migrate Executes Django's migrate management task. In addition to migrating the database, this command creates the default admin user. Gulp also passes along non-overlapping arguments for this command. reset Resets the database to a default state with one fake child and 31 days of fake data. runserver Executes Django's runserver management task. Gulp passes non-overlapping arguments for this command. A special parameter, --ip , is also available to set the IP for the server. E.g., execute gulp runserver --ip 0.0.0.0:8000 to make the server available to other devices on your local network. scripts Builds and combines relevant application scripts. Generally this command does not need to be executed independently - see the build command. styles Builds and combines SASS styles in to CSS files. Generally this command does not need to be executed independently - see the build command. test Executes Baby Buddy's suite of tests. Gulp also passes along non-overlapping arguments for this command, however individual tests cannot be run with this command. python manage.py test can be used for individual test execution. updateglyphs Downloads generated glyph font files data from Fonttello based on config.json file .

For any deployment, log in and change the default password immediately . Many of Baby Buddy's configuration settings can be controlled using environment variables - see Configuration for detailed information. Docker Baby Buddy relies on the LinuxServer.io community for a multi-architecture container with strong support. See linuxserver/docker-babybuddy for detailed information about the container or use the following Docker Compose configuration as a template to get started quickly: version : \"2.1\" services : babybuddy : image : lscr.io/linuxserver/babybuddy container_name : babybuddy volumes : - /path/to/appdata:/config ports : - 8000:8000 restart : unless-stopped See Django's databases documentation for database requirements. See HTTPS/SSL configuration for information on how to secure Baby Buddy. Running commands Run administrative commands with the /app/www/public/manage.py script. Set the environment variables DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE and SECRET_KEY before running commands. For example: docker exec -it babybuddy /bin/bash export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE = \"babybuddy.settings.base\" export SECRET_KEY = \" $( cat /config/.secretkey ) \" cd /app/www/public python manage.py --help Note: the container name ( babybuddy ) and secret key location ( /config/.secretkey ) may differ depending on the container configuration. Refer to the running containers configuration for these values. Home Assistant Home Assistant is an open source home automation tool that can be used to host and control Baby Buddy. An existing Home Assistant installation is required to use this method. See the community-maintained Baby Buddy Home Assistant Addon for installation instructions and then review the community-maintained Baby Buddy Home Assistant integration for added integrations with the base Home Assistant system. See also How to Setup Baby Buddy in Home Assistant from Smart Home Scene for more detailed installation and configuration instructions. Digital Ocean Info The Digital Ocean deployment and link URLs include referal codes. All referral funds receieved are treated as donations to Baby Buddy. There are two ways to deploy Baby Buddy to Digital Ocean -- as a droplet from a marketplace image or as an app. The marketplace image is the cheaper option ($6/month), but may require more manual configuration depending on desired features and is limited to the latest release the marketplace image has been approved for. The app can be de deployed from any tag or the main branch and can be managed in the Digital Ocean console via environment variables, but it costs at least $12/month. Create droplet Cost : $6+/month Use the button below to create a new droplet using the Baby Buddy marketplace image. Access and configuration instructions will be provided after the droplet has been started and configured by the image. Create app Cost : $12+/month Use the button below to start a new deploy to Digital Ocean . Modify the app environment variables during the build configuration and set the SECRET_KEY value to something random and unique. Digital Ocean's automatic secret generator does not work with Baby Buddy. Clever Cloud To deploy on Clever Cloud , log in to your Clever Cloud console , create a Python application, link it to a PostgreSQL addon and optionally a Cellar S3 Storage addon (only if you want file storage for child picture in particular). Then make sure to set the following environment variables in your Python application before pushing the babybuddy source code: CC_PYTHON_BACKEND = uwsgi CC_PYTHON_MANAGE_TASKS = migrate CC_PYTHON_MODULE = babybuddy.wsgi:application DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE = babybuddy.settings.clever-cloud SECRET_KEY = <CHANGE TO SOMETHING RANDOM> AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = <DESIRED BUCKET NAME> # only if file storage is needed See Configuration for other environment variables available for your instance of babybuddy. After that, you just have to push babybuddy code repository to the Git deployment URL of your Clever Cloud Python application. GCP Cloud Run Baby Buddy can be hosted serverless in GCP Cloud Run using configuration provided at terraform/gcp-cloud-run . The configuration scales down to zero for cost-effectiveness. With this approach initial requests to the service after a long period will be slow but subsequent requests will be much faster. A billing account mut be configured in GCP to use the configuration.
