# Development environment

[![Gitpod ready-to-code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Gitpod-ready--to--code-blue?logo=gitpod)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/babybuddy/babybuddy)

Click the Gitpod badge to open a new development environment in Gitpod or use the
information and steps below to set up a local development environment for Baby Buddy.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+, pip, pipenv
- NodeJS 18.x and NPM 8.x (NVM recommended)
- Gulp
- Possibly `libpq-dev`
  - This is necessary if `psycopg2` can't find an appropriate prebuilt binary.

## Installation

1. Install pipenv per [Installing pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/installation/)

1. Install required Python packages, including dev packages

   ```shell
   pipenv install --three --dev
   ```

   If this fails, install `libpq-dev` (e.g. `sudo apt install libpq-dev`) and try again.

1. Installed Node 18.x (if necessary)

   ```shell
   nvm install 18
   ```

1. Activate Node 18.x

   ```shell
   nvm use
   ```

1. Install Gulp CLI

   ```shell
   npm install -g gulp-cli
   ```

1. Install required Node packages

   ```shell
   npm install
   ```

1. Set, at least, the `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` environment variable

   ```shell
   export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=babybuddy.settings.development
   ```

   This process will differ based on the host OS. The above example is for
   Linux-based systems. See [Configuration](../configuration/intro.md) for other
   settings and methods for defining them.

1. Migrate the database

   ```shell
   gulp migrate
   ```

1. Build assets and run the server

   ```shell
   gulp
   ```

   This command will also watch for file system changes to rebuild assets and
   restart the server as needed.

Open [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000) and log in with the default
username and password (`admin`/`admin`).

## Alternative: https://devenv.sh/

1. Install devenv (linux/mac/windows subsystem for linux/docker) via https://devenv.sh/getting-started/
1. git clone the repo
1. here you have two options
   1. run `devenv shell` and then run `gulp`
   1. _OR_ run `devenv up` which automatically runs gulp/nodejs/python as well
1. Open [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000) and log in with the default
   username and password (`admin`/`admin`).

Devenv also generates the **.devcontainer for vscode**, and sets up **github codespaces support**. To run babybuddy in the devcontainer or codespaces, open a terminal after opening this repo in the devcontainer, which causes the dependencies to be installed via `devenv shell`. Then, run `gulp` to start the baby buddy server.

### Debugging in devenv + vscode

To debug in devenv + vscode/codespaces:

1. add a `.vscode/launch.json` file like this:

```json
{
  // Use IntelliSense to learn about possible attributes.
  // Hover to view descriptions of existing attributes.
  // For more information, visit: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=830387
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "Python: Django",
      "type": "python",
      "request": "launch",
      "program": "${workspaceFolder}/manage.py",
      "env": {
        "DEBUG": "False"
      },
      "args": ["runserver"],
      "django": true,
      "justMyCode": true
    }
  ]
}
```

2. Consider running `gulp fake --children 5 --days 7` as explained in the [gulp command reference](./gulp-command-reference.md) to add some fake data to the database
3. Click Run -> Start Debugging (F5) and set your breakpoints in the python as desired
